GPU-Accelerated Cellular Automata Engine ( C++ / Vulkan API )

## Building from source

This application must be built from the source code, currently.

It requires the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home).

To build the application, use the CMake generator of your choice (such as [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) on linux)

### On Windows

Using the CMake GUI tool, point "Where is the source code" to the root directory of the project and "Where to build the binaries" to the bin folder.
You can then press the "Configure" and "Generate" buttons, choosing the generator of your liking, which is probably Visual Studio.

You can also open the root directory in Visual Studio and it should automatically do these steps for you.

### On Linux

Open the terminal at `./VulkanAutomata`

`mkdir build`

`cd build`

`cmake ..`

`make`

`./vulkan_automata`

Or run `Linux_BuildMakeRun.sh` and hope for the best.
